I'm happy to introduce **Slick: The QA Automation Learning Stack**: a set of software
tools that facilitate learning _how to code_ and write _simple, robust_ browser-based
acceptance tests, for absolute beginners or Quality Assurance / Testing Professionals
with manual testing backgrounds.

The primary tools we'll use are:

1. **Ruby**, a dynamic programming language, in which we'll implement our test logic.
2. **Watir**, for "driving", or automating, the browser.
3. **RSpec**, the Ruby test framework, for writing "expectations", or pass/fail assertions.
