We chose these tools because they are well-known, battle-tested, and
have a low barrier to entry. That said, there is a lot of enthusiasm around other
tools, especially Google Chrome's [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)
and Graphcool's fantastic [Chromeless](https://github.com/graphcool/chromeless)
JavaScript package (which decreased test durations from ~20min to a few seconds
for them!), so if there's enough interest, I'd be happy to write a guide for
JavaScript-based browser automation in the future.
